DOCUMENT CHECKLIST STRUCTURE
To automate immigration casework effectively, Xeni needs a consistent way to represent every piece of evidence submitted by a client. The Home Office organises requirements at a category level (e.g., Financial Requirement, English Language), but lawyers work with documents, bundles, and raw files that rarely match this structure. The following four-layer hierarchy—Category → Document Type → Document Instance → Files—provides a unified model that mirrors how evidence is requested, reviewed, assembled, and submitted in practice. It allows Xeni to: generate accurate checklists, classify and assemble documents automatically, extract structured data for analysis, flag missing or inconsistent evidence, and produce submission-ready bundles for lawyers and caseworkers. This model is the foundation for the Liaison, Auditor, and Analyst workflows across the entire Xeni system.
TOP-LEVEL STRUCTURE
EVIDENCE CATEGORY  
 → DOCUMENT TYPE  
 → DOCUMENT INSTANCE  
 → FILES (raw uploads)

This 4-layer model allows Xeni to replicate exactly how immigration evidence is required, reviewed, and submitted.

1. EVIDENCE CATEGORY (Home Office category level)
   This is the highest level and corresponds to how the Home Office organises evidence.
   Examples (for Partner/Spouse Visa) (View full list of partner/spouse documents)a :
   Identity & Personal Status
   Relationship Evidence
   Accommodation
   Financial Requirement (Category A/B/C/F etc.)
   English Language
   Suitability
   Immigration History
   Translations
   Cohabitation Evidence / Proof of Address
   Children (if applicable)
   Sponsor Eligibility
   Other Supporting Evidence

Rules:
Categories shown are determined by visa route, then refined by case details.

Categories can be marked required, optional, or conditional.

Each category contains multiple valid Document Types.
Some Documents uploaded may not be valid for any category and this should be flagged as invalid and require a lawyer to review and categories manually if the system has made an error

2. DOCUMENT TYPE (Valid types of evidence within a category)
   These correspond to the specific kinds of documents the Home Office accepts.
   Examples under each category

Visa-Type Specific Rules
Document Types shown depend on:
Visa route
In-country vs entry clearance
Dependants vs adults
Case nuances (self-employed, sponsor abroad, etc.)

3. DOCUMENT INSTANCE (The “bundle” lawyers work with)
   A Document Instance is what lawyers consider a "document" for submission purposes.
   It is made up of one or more Files uploaded by the client.
   Examples:
   Example: Bank Statements (6 months)
   Document Type: Bank Statements
   Instances:

Bank Statements June 2024
Bank Statements July 2024
…

Or: “Bank Statements (6 months combined)” — created by Auditor Agent

Example: Proof of Cohabitation
Document Type: Council Tax Bills
Instances:

Council Tax Bill 2023
Council Tax Bill 2024

Example: Passport
Document Type: Passport

Instances:

Passport (Applicant)
Passport (Sponsor)

Example: Photos
All photo uploads are combined into a single Photo Evidence instance.

Rules for Document Instances
Instances can be automatically created (e.g., one per month).
Instances are versioned, as clients often resend corrected versions.
Each instance receives a status:

Submitted
Incomplete
Needs Review
Approved
Rejected

4. FILES (Raw uploads)
   These are the actual files sent by the client:
   email attachments
   WhatsApp images
   PDF uploads
   zipped folders
   screenshots
   camera photos

The Liaison Agent ingests the files → Auditor Agent reformats them → Analyst Agent interprets them.
File rules
Files are first classified into a Document Type

Files may be merged into a Document Instance (e.g., six PDF payslips → one payslip bundle)
Files can be replaced as clients reupload
Files inherit metadata:

upload channel
timestamp
sender
confidence score

HOW THE HIERARCHY WORKS IN PRACTICE FOR A SPOUSE VISA
Example:
Category: Financial Requirement
Document Type: Payslips (Category A)
Document Instances:
Payslip Apr 2024
Payslip May 2024
Payslip Jun 2024
…

Files:
IMG_2031.jpg (WhatsApp)
payslip_june.pdf (Email)

The system:
Detects file type (payslip)
Extracts date
Creates/assigns a Document Instance
Normalises format via Auditor Agent
Analyst Agent checks if:

period is correct
duplicates exist
missing months
That the combined amounts in the payslip meet the home-office criteria for the visa type being applied for

Liaison Agent updates the checklist dynamically in real time.

ADDING CASE LOGIC & CONDITIONALITY
Each evidence category is shown or hidden based on:

1. Visa Type
   Example:
   English Language always required
   Savings route only shown if client selects “Savings”

2. Case Details
   Examples:
   Self-employed? → show SA302 + accounts
   Sponsor abroad? → show “Sponsor Return to UK Evidence”
   Children? → show birth certificates

3. Analyst Agent Findings
   Example:
   If Analyst detects missing July bank statement → creates “Missing Document” instance
   Liaison Agent chases automatically
